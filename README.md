### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my ability to write instructions in their simplest form.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning that patience needs to be constant and changes are inevitable.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that's level 1/beginner/ easy. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with understanding how to use Github from top to bottom.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about books, video games and airline food (red eye flights).
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: byankacampos@remind101.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I own more (new) books than read books. Does that make sense?
